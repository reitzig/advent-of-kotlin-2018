# Advent of Kotlin (2018)

My solutions for Kotlin Academy's 
    [Advent of Kotlin](https://blog.kotlin-academy.com/the-advent-of-kotlin-2018-week-1-229e442a143)
(2018).

### Building

Building requires Gradle 5.0 with Kotlin DSL and Kotlin 1.3. As usual,

    gradle test
    
runs all tests, provided the setup works okay.

The code uses experimental features of Kotlin 1.3.
